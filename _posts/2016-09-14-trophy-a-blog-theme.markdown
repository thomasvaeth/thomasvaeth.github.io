If you have talked to me, then you know that I love Jekyll (my current website is built using it). Why would you want a blog on a CMS when you could have it on static pages? So I spent a couple of evenings making a free theme named Trophy. Trophy uses HTML, Sass, and JavaScript (no jQuery).

I wrote very detailed documentation, so it's super easy to download and plug all of your information in. Everything gets put right into the `_config.yml` file. I used BEM to structure the code, so if you wanted to change additional things like some compenent you can find it pretty quickly.

And look at how nice that JavaScript is written without jQuery. That module is for the picture display on the index page.

It has been featured over the past few days on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/pen/vXNmwX" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and <a href="https://site.uplabs.com/posts/trophy-jekyll-theme" target="_blank">UpLabs</a>.
