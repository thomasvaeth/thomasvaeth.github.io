<p>2015 was completely different from any other year. I made some small changes like eating more vegetables and some big changes like moving across the country. I am looking forward to 2016, but here is a little recap of my last year in emojis:</p>
<div class="emoji"><img src="/assets/images/emoji/emoji-1.png" alt="Emoji"/></div>
<p>I went to Asia for the first time when I visited Thailand for a couple of weeks. I went with my girlfriend to Bangkok and Phuket. I cannot wait to go back.</p>

<p>I started teaching myself JavaScript. That is what this whole blog is about.</p>
<div class="emoji"><img src="/assets/images/emoji/emoji-3.png" alt="Emoji"/></div>
<p>I made a big decision that life science is no longer what I am interested in. I no longer wanted to continue being a biochemist and I wanted to concentrate on web development full time.</p>

<p>No more commuting by train everyday!</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I decided we have spent enough years in Philadelphia and it was time to move to Seattle.</p>

<p>Why did it take me so long to play Portal and Portal 2? I finally bought them during a Steam sale. It is my favorite game (besides FIFA Soccer).</p>

<p>I started a web development bootcamp at General Assembly. There were a lot of late nights working on homework and projects, but also a lot of games of ping pong.</p>

<p>I ate a lot of <a href="http://youarepizza.com/" target="_blank">pizza</a>. And I deployed my first full stack web application.</p>

<p>12 weeks later I finished General Assembly. I learned a lot by coding everyday and being around people who coded.</p>

<p>I kept it 100.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
