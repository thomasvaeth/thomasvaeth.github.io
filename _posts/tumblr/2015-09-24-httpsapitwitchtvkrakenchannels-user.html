<p>I finished a <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-use-the-twitchtv-json-api" target="_blank">fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage" target="_blank">fifth</a> project on FreeCodeCamp. The fourth one was to use the Twitch.tv JSON API to see users who are currently streaming or offline. Here is a code snippet of calling the JSON API:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/8eb087f8045e242a6c8b.js"></script><p>This was the hardest project I have worked on so far. I had to go back to Codecademy a few times to figure out how to get the search to work. I wanted to make it that when you searched a string of characters any in that order would show up and not just the characters in the beginning. I did that using &gt;= 0 instead of just &gt; 0 or === 0. Here is what the search function looks like:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/d7b92a191d1ec5d28b8a.js"></script><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="546" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/ed1f9eda8265a4b4db7de54fec5de101/tumblr_inline_nv6wlnR7cC1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="546" data-orig-width="1024" alt="image"/></figure><p>You can view the project on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/full/EVyabe/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and get all of the code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp/tree/master/twitch-tv" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br/>The fifth one was to make a personal portfolio webpage using a Bootstrap template to showcase all the projects I completed. It was easy to plug everything in compared to the other projects I have done, so I am not going to go into it at all. You can view the project on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/full/WQxQem/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and get all of the code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp/tree/master/personal-portfolio-webpage" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
