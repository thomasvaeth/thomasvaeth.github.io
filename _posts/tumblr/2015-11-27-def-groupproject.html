<p>Week 9 is done. I am three quarters through General Assembly Seattle now. The project I worked on for the past week has been <a href="https://farestart.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Fare Start</a>. It was a group project built in Ruby on Rails to get Uber and Lyft quotes before picking which one to use.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1612" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/58f8a618224777c53018760633627665/tumblr_inline_nzo4yu2lvk1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1612" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1610" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/59d60f77cd51fc79ae6c20cc0a2ce7d6/tumblr_inline_nzo4z6HHnF1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1610" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1612" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/4623cb78a14493c4147c0a4650a2603a/tumblr_inline_nzo4zm5VSj1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1612" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><p>We wanted to build something that people would use while still meeting the project requirements. The requirements were to create an application using at least two database models, user authentication, and CRUD functionality. One of the models saved data from every search to generate a map using D3.js. The map can be sorted by total searches per state, average Uber fare, and average Lyft fare. Another feature we added was mobile deep linking where the user can open the Uber or Lyft app from the search results page with the to and from already filled in for them. We also used four APIs to build Fare Start: Uber, Google Maps Javascript, Google Maps Geocoding, and Freegeoip. Lyft did not have an available API at the time.</p><p>This project was the first time I worked in a group and it was a learning experience. We had to assign different roles to each member instead of just going for it yourself. We also were working on one repository, so we had to quickly learn how to avoid merge conflicts on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-rails" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I also got to work with Sass, which made changing colors much quicker.</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/0586e744254e47d9d3ca.js"></script></p>
