<p>I finished a <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-use-the-twitchtv-json-api" target="_blank">fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage" target="_blank">fifth</a> project on FreeCodeCamp. The fourth one was to use the Twitch.tv JSON API to see users who are currently streaming or offline. Here is a code snippet of calling the JSON API:</p>

<p>This was the hardest project I have worked on so far. I had to go back to Codecademy a few times to figure out how to get the search to work. I wanted to make it that when you searched a string of characters any in that order would show up and not just the characters in the beginning. I did that using &gt;= 0 instead of just &gt; 0 or === 0. Here is what the search function looks like:</p>

<p>You can view the project on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/full/EVyabe/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and get all of the code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp/tree/master/twitch-tv" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The fifth one was to make a personal portfolio webpage using a Bootstrap template to showcase all the projects I completed. It was easy to plug everything in compared to the other projects I have done, so I am not going to go into it at all.
