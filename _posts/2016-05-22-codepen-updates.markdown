I have not had time to work on any big personal projects, so I have just been trying to add small things to CodePen every weekend recently.

I am back at it with the linear gradients here. This time I am using `background-clip` and an animation to slowly rotate the color of the text. I also have an animation for the width of the line break.

The SVG animation was featured on CodePen last weekend. It has 1,688 views at the time of writing this, which is almost triple my previously most viewed project. The animation is taking the circle from one y-coordinate to another while fading in and fading out again. I added Parallax to the SVG, so it moves around depending on the user's interaction with the page.

I made this one yesterday. It is a navigation built using flexbox. I like using flexbox for navigations because it is easy to get the `ul` set up horizontally. `display: flex;`, `list-style-type: none;`, and it is ready to go. I used DOM instead of jQuery to change to a sticky navigation. I also converted a font to Base64. This small project is my favorite one so far because it can easily be used in any project and I plan on using it when needed.
